## Welcome!

I'm a Backend Developer, Software Engineer, Tech Consultant, and InfoSec Aficionado.

I've worked with regular and institutional companies developing solutions focused primarily on PHP, JavaScript, and Python tech stacks. Also been around on the entrepreneurship environment as co-founder, dev-leader, and other tech roles focused on prototyping and research.

Currently focused on data AIDC Solutions and malware development.
